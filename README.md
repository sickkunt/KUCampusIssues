# KUCampusIssues
This project is a **campus issue tracking and management system** designed to empower students, staff, and administrators to collaboratively report, track, and resolve issues on campus. Built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, the application provides a user-friendly interface for submitting and managing reports about various problems, such as maintenance needs, safety concerns, or logistical challenges. The system supports features like user authentication, image uploads, real-time updates via AJAX, and admin moderation tools, making it both functional and interactive.

At its core, the platform allows authenticated users to **post new issues**, providing details such as a title, description, location, and an optional image to visually document the problem. Each issue can be tracked through its lifecycle, with statuses including "new," "in progress," and "resolved." Users can also engage with issues by liking them to express support or agreement, which helps prioritize attention to popular or urgent matters. The homepage displays a paginated list of all issues, with options to filter by status (e.g., resolved or unresolved) and sort by criteria like newest, oldest, or most-liked issues.

Administrators have additional privileges, including the ability to update issue statuses, delete issues, and view an **admin dashboard** that provides statistical insights into the system. The dashboard highlights key metrics, such as the total number of issues, their distribution across statuses, and recently reported issues for quick moderation. The system ensures secure authentication using password hashing and protects sensitive routes with role-based access control, ensuring only authorized users can perform administrative actions.

The project emphasizes usability and scalability. For example, it uses AJAX for seamless interactions, such as liking issues without refreshing the page, and includes a preview feature for uploaded images. Additionally, it incorporates proper error handling, logging, and file management to maintain robustness. Designed for educational institutions, this application fosters transparency and accountability while promoting community-driven solutions to campus challenges.
